# PaperTrade – Local DevOps Project (Project 1)

## 1. Project Overview

PaperTrade is a practice project to simulate stock paper-trading for the Indian market (NSE/BSE) using a simple local setup.  
The goal is to learn end‑to‑end DevOps fundamentals: coding, version control, basic testing, and local deployment.

## 2. Tech Stack

- Backend: Python + Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Storage (Phase 1): In‑memory data structures (Python lists/dicts)
- Storage (Later, optional): SQLite (file-based local database)
- Market Data (Phase 1): Mock NSE/BSE stock data (hardcoded)
- Market Data (Later): Free NSE/BSE market data API

## 3. Features (Planned for Project 1)

- View a simple list of mock NSE/BSE stocks with price and change
- Create a fake “portfolio” using in‑memory buy/sell actions
- Reset portfolio data during development and testing
- Run everything locally on a single laptop

## 4. DevOps Focus

- Use Git and GitHub for version control
- Follow a clean commit history and basic branching
- Prepare for CI/CD with GitHub Actions (later phase)
- Prepare for containerization with Docker (later phase)

## 5. How to Run (Planned)

> Detailed commands will be added after backend and frontend are implemented.

For now, the project only contains the initial structure:
- `backend/` – Python backend (Flask app will be added here)
- `frontend/` – HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- `README.md` – Project documentation
